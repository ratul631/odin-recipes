    <h2>Description    </h2>
    This milk chocolate frosting is smooth, creamy, and not too dark. I've been using this chocolate frosting recipe forever, and several friends now use it as their "favorite frosting!" I just wanted to share it with chocolate lovers everywhere! It will frost, but not fill, an 8- or 9-inch cake.
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2Â¾ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons evaporated milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    </li>
</ul>
